        <p><font size="2"><b><a name="carcinoid"></a>Carcinoid Heart Disease:</b> 
          Thickening of the heart valves (right sided more commonly) often with 
          marked regurgitation associated with a metastatic carcinoid tumor. (Carcinoid 
          is of a chromaffin cell origin, usually originating in the small bowel).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b><a name="chordae"></a>Chordae Tendinae:</b> A thin

          Congenital anomaly characterized by inferior displacement of the tricuspid 
          valve resulting in a small &#8220;true&#8221; right ventricle inferior 
          to the tricuspid valve and an &#8220;atrialized&#8221; component of 
          the right ventricle along with the true right atrium superior to the 
          valve.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b><a name="eisenmenger"></a>Eisenmenger's Physiology:</b> 
          Reversal of flow through a cardiac defect from <i>L to R</i> to <i>R 
          to L</i> because of an increase in right sided pressures secondary to 
          marked pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension, in turn, is due 
          to increased peripheral pulmonary vascular impedance.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b><a name="endocarditis"></a>Endocarditis: </b>Inflammation 
          of the valvular leaflets often secondary to a bacterial infection. Non 
          infectious causes are less common such as lupus.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b><a name="av"></a>First degree AV block:</b> Prolongation 
          of conduction time through the atria or through the AV node manifesting 
          as a prolonged P-R interval on the surface electrocardiogram.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b><a name="gallavardin"></a>Gallavardin Phenomenon:</b> 
          Radiation of the aortic stenosis murmur to the apex (most commonly seen 
          in the elderly).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b><a name="homograft"></a>Homograft:</b> Artificial 
          valve consisting of a transplanted biological valve from the same species 
          as the recipient.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b><a name="lupus"></a>Lupus:</b> Collagen vascular 
          disease associated with autoantibodies to various organs. May be associated 
          with the formation of non-infectious endocarditis.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b><a name="marfan"></a>Marfan&#8217;s syndrome:</b> 
          Syndrome characterized by a connective tissue defect resulting in a 
          tendency towards aortic dissection and/or expansion of the proximal 
          aorta; is associated with mitral valve prolapse, hyperextendable joints, 
          and lens dislocation. Patients are usually tall and thin with summation 
          of the length from fingertip to fingertip of each arm when extended 
          laterally exceeding or equaling their height.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b><a name="mucopoly"></a>Mucopolysaccharidosis:</b> 
          Deposition of abnormal fat and protein within the cardiac valve leaflets.</font></p>

          Characterized by impaired mental abilities, abnormal facies, hypertrophic 
          cardiomyopathy, pulmonary or infundibular stenosis, peripheral pulmonary 
          artery stenosis, patent ductus arteriosus, atrial septal defect and 
          tetralogy of Fallot.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b><a name="opening"></a>Opening Snap:</b> High pitched 
          presystolic sound associated with opening of a stiff atrioventricular 
          valve.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b><a name="split"></a>Paradoxical Splitting of the 
          second heart sound:</b> In its milder form paradoxical splitting of 
          the S2 is associated with narrowing of S2 split with inspiration. In 
          the advanced form P2 of the second heart sound can appear before A2 
          (often due to prolonged flow through the aortic valve causing a delay 
          in closure.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b><a name="phen"></a>Phen-fen:</b> Weight loss drug 
          associated with valvular abnormalities and/or pulmonary hypertension 
          no longer available on the market.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b><a name="impedance"></a>Pulmonary Vascular Impedance:</b> 
          The resistance to flow existing within the blood vessels leading into

          sexually transmitted disease which may be associated with inflammation, 
          expansion and or dissection of the proximal aorta.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b><a name="tetralogy"></a>Tetralogy of Fallot:</b> 
          Congenital heart abnormality characterized by 1) Pulmonary outflow tract 
          obstruction such as pulmonic stenosis, 2) Ventricular septal defect, 
          3) Overriding aorta, 4) Right ventricular hypertrophy.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b><a name="valsalva"></a>Valsalva:</b> Physiologic 
          maneuver in which intraabdominal pressure is increased (usually by bearing 
          down against a closed glottis) resulting in initial inhibition of right 
          ventricular blood return followed by a rapid increase in return once 
          abdominal pressure is released.</font></p>
